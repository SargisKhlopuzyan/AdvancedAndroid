/**
 * IMPORTANT *****************************
 * CoroutineExceptionHandler is invoked only on uncaught exceptions â€” exceptions that were not handled in any other way.
 * In particular, all children coroutines (coroutines created in the context of another Job) delegate handling of
 * their exceptions to their parent coroutine, which also delegates to the parent, and so on until the root,
 * so the CoroutineExceptionHandler installed in their context is never used. In addition to that,
 * async builder always catches all exceptions and represents them in the resulting Deferred object,
 * so its CoroutineExceptionHandler has no effect either.
